Vector t‑shirt logo for an 8‑ball pool team named 'Gremlins'. Central emblem: a glossy, defensive 8‑ball used as a shield/seat. A sly, athletic gremlin (sharp ears, mischievous grin, compact muscular pose) perches on the 8‑ball, leaning on a pool cue. Visual hint of aversion to water only — small water droplets and tiny splashes bounce or bead off the 8‑ball and a folded umbrella tucked behind the gremlin (no written motto). Use motion lines and tiny ricochet marks to show droplets repelling. Integrate the team name 'GREMLINS' as a bold, slightly jagged wordmark arced beneath the emblem. Style: modern mascot/emblem blend, clean bold outlines, strong silhouette for easy printing. Color palette: primary gremlin green, warning red accents, deep black outlines/8‑ball, sharp yellow highlights (eyes, small trim). Output: flat‑color and full‑color printable variants, transparent background, scalable vector suitable for screenprinting on shirts.
