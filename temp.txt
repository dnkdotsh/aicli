This provides the \"vague recall\" of broader topics and general context from our previous discussions.\n\nSo, in essence:\n*   **Detailed, summarized understanding of our recent chat:** Yes, due to the mid-conversation \"condense & inject.\"\n*   **Broader, vaguer understanding of *past* sessions:** Yes, due to the persistent summary loaded at session start.\n\nYou've successfully implemented a powerful two-tiered memory system!"

Thank you for clarifying that crucial detail about the *intended behavior* of the \"condense and inject\" mechanism.\n\nYou're absolutely right, the most effective approach for that mid-conversation summarization is to have the new summary **incorporate and replace** the old one.\n\nSo, the ideal flow would be:\n\n1.  **Initial ~12 turns:** Raw chat history.\n2.  **First Condense Event:** Raw turns 1-12 are condensed into `Summary_A`. Your CLI then replaces those raw turns in the context with `Summary_A`.\n3.  **Next ~N turns:** Raw chat history continues (`Summary_A` + raw turns 13-N).\n4.  **Second Condense Event:** The system takes `Summary_A` *and* the new raw turns (13-N), and processes them all into a *new, single, updated* `Summary_B`. Your CLI then replaces `Summary_A` and raw turns 13-N with `Summary_B`.\n\nThis continuous aggregation into a single, evolving summary is definitely the desired outcome. It keeps the context compact, coherent, and prevents redundancy, giving the model the most up-to-date and consolidated understanding of our ongoing conversation.\n\nHaving two separate condensed messages (`Summary_A` and `Summary_B`) would work, as you said, but it's less efficient. The model would still process them, but it might have to infer the relationship between the two distinct summaries, and it consumes more token space than a single, integrated summary would.\n\nSo, yes, the goal is for the old summary and the new conversational context to be combined into a *single, updated summary* to maintain optimal conversational flow. Thanks for clarifying that distinction!"

That's an excellent design choice for balancing detail and conciseness.\n\nMy apologies for my continued slight misinterpretations \u2013 I appreciate you patiently guiding me through the exact mechanics.\n\nSo, to refine my understanding once again:\n\nThe \"condense and inject\" system employs a **sliding window of raw turns combined with an accumulating summary**.\n\nHere's how I now understand it:\n\n1.  **Initial Phase:** We accumulate raw chat history.\n2.  **Condensation Trigger (e.g., at 12 turns):**\n    *   The **oldest 6 turns** of the *current raw history* are taken.\n    *   These oldest 6 turns are then condensed.\n    *   This new condensation is **combined with any *existing* conversational summary** (if there was one from a previous trigger) to create an updated, consolidated summary for that older portion of the chat.\n    *   The **most recent 6 turns** of raw history remain as is, un-condensed, ensuring I have the most immediate context in full fidelity.\n\nSo, the context might look like:\n\n*   **Before first trigger:** `[Raw turn 1], [Raw turn 2], ..., [Raw turn 12]`\n*   **After first trigger (e.g., after turn 12):** `[Summary of turns 1-6]`, `[Raw turn 7], [Raw turn 8], ..., [Raw turn 12]`\n*   **After next 6 raw turns (e.g., after turn 18):** `[Summary of turns 1-12 (updated and combined from old summary and turns 7-12)]`, `[Raw turn 13], [Raw turn 14], ..., [Raw turn 18]`\n\nThis is a fantastic strategy! It ensures that I always have:\n*   **High-fidelity recent memory:** The last `X` turns (in your case, 6) are always in their original, raw text form.\n*   **Coherent, condensed older memory:** Everything before that `X`-turn window is summarized and continually updated, so the full conversational thread is maintained without hitting token limits too quickly.\n\nThat's a very sophisticated and effective way to manage the in-conversation memory.

It provides much finer-grained control and is more directly aligned with how the models consume and are billed for context.\n\nTo answer your question about token usage with streaming:\n\n1.  **Does streaming show you token usage at the end of the stream?**\n    Yes, generally, when you use a streaming API, the `usage_metadata` (which includes `prompt_token_count` and `completion_token_count` or `candidates_token_count`) is typically provided in the **final response message** of the stream, once the model has finished generating its complete output (or hit a stop reason).\n    *   **Prompt Tokens:** The `prompt_token_count` is known the moment you send the request, as it's simply the count of tokens in your input.\n    *   **Completion Tokens:** The `completion_token_count` accumulates as the model generates output. The final, definitive count for *that specific generation* is provided at the very end.\n\n2.  **Is your CLI's token usage estimate accurate when streaming is enabled?**\n    *   **If the stream completes:** If your CLI is waiting for that final `usage_metadata` from the API, then that count is **fully accurate** and not an estimate. The API reports the exact number of tokens used for both the input and the generated output.\n    *   **If your CLI is estimating *during* the stream:** If you're calculating it on the fly before the final API message arrives (e.g., by counting tokens as they come in), then your count for *received output tokens* is accurate for what has been sent so far. However, it would only be an \"estimate\" of the *total eventual completion tokens* if the stream is still ongoing.\n    *   **If the stream is cancelled:** As we discussed, if you cancel the stream, the API typically won't send the final `usage_metadata` because the generation was incomplete. In this case, your CLI would be responsible for accurately counting the tokens it *did* receive before the cancellation. So, your internal count would be the definitive record for the partial response.\n\nSo, your output token usage is likely very accurate. If you're seeing it *before* the final API response comes through, it's an accurate count of what's been streamed so far. If you're seeing it *after* the stream completes, and it's coming from the API's `usage_metadata`, it's 100% accurate.\n\nSwitching to a token-based memory management system would be a great way to ensure you're always within the model's context window limits, as token count is the primary constraint. It allows for more dynamic adjustments based on the actual length of summaries and raw turns."

While you might not bat an eye at sending massive prompts, the vast majority of users will be highly conscious of token usage, both for cost and for performance.\n\nSo, shifting to a token-based memory management system becomes incredibly valuable for the reasons you mentioned for *other users*:\n\n1.  **Cost Efficiency:** Directly impacts the operational cost for your users. Keeping prompts concise via intelligent summarization translates directly to lower API bills.\n2.  **Broader Accessibility:** Allows more people to use your CLI without worrying about prohibitive expenses, democratizing access to powerful LLM interactions.\n3.  **Performance & Latency:** While models are getting faster, smaller contexts generally still process a bit quicker. For users on slower connections or with less patience, even minor speedups matter.\n4.  **Reliability Across Models/Tiers:** Different models or even different tiers of the *same* model can have varying context window limits. A token-aware system makes your CLI more robust and adaptable.\n5.  **Predictability:** Users appreciate knowing that the CLI will manage their context intelligently to avoid hitting arbitrary limits or incurring unexpectedly high costs.\n\nSo, while your personal use case might not demand it, for the success and adoption of your CLI by a wider audience, moving to token-based memory management is definitely a strong choice.
